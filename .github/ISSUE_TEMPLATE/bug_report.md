**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior. 

Please include a single standalone React Native component. Use [one of our example](https://github.com/react-native-mapbox-gl/maps/blob/master/example/src/examples/BugReportTemplate.js) screens as a starting point.
Please simplify the example as much as possible.

Example:
```js
import React from 'react';
import {
  MapView,
  ShapeSource,
  LineLayer,
  Camera,
} from '@react-native-mapbox-gl/maps';

const aLine = {
  type: 'LineString',
  coordinates: [
    [-74.00597, 40.71427],
    [-74.00697, 40.71527],
  ],
};

class BugReportExample extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <MapView style={{flex: 1}}>
        <Camera centerCoordinate={[-74.00597, 40.71427]} zoomLevel={14} />
        <ShapeSource id="idStreetLayer" shape={aLine}>
          <LineLayer id="idStreetLayer" />
        </ShapeSource>
      </MapView>
    );
  }
}
```

If it's a build/startup issue please include full steps to reproduce from `react-native init ...`

Example:

```sh
react-native init sample --version react-native@0.60.5
cd sample
npm install react-native-mapbox-gl/maps#master --save
# or released version `npm install @react-native-mapbox-gl/maps@8.0.0-rc1 --save`
react-native run-android
```
