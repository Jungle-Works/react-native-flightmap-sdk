# Getting Started

Congratulations, you successfully installed react-native-flightmap-gl/flightmap! ðŸŽ‰
Where to go from here?
You can head straight to [examples](/example) folder if you want to jump into the deep end.
However, if you prefer an easier ramp-up, then make sure to stick around and check out the guides below.

## Setting your accessToken

In order to work, flightmap requires you to create an accessToken and set it in your app.
If you haven't created one yet, make sure to sign up for an account [here](https://app.flightmap.io)
Once you have your accessToken, set it like this

```js
import FlightmapGL from "@react-native-flightmap-gl/flightmap";

FlightmapGL.setAccessToken("<YOUR_ACCESSTOKEN>");
```

## Setting connection status [Android only]

If you are hosting styles and sources on localhost, you might need to set the connection status manually for flightmap to be able to use them.

Manually sets the connectivity state of the app, bypassing any checks to the ConnectivityManager. Set to `true` for connected, `false` for disconnected, and `null` for ConnectivityManager to determine.

```js
import FlightmapGL from "@react-native-flightmap-gl/flightmap";

FlightmapGL.setConnected(true);
```

## Disabling Telemetry

By default flightmap collects telemetry.
If you would like to programmatically disable this within your app add the code below.

```js
  componentDidMount() {
    FlightmapGL.setTelemetryEnabled(false);
  }
```

## Show a map

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, View } from "react-native";
import FlightmapGL from "@react-native-flightmap-gl/flightmap";

FlightmapGL.setAccessToken("<YOUR_ACCESSTOKEN>");

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  page: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    backgroundColor: "#F5FCFF"
  },
  container: {
    height: 300,
    width: 300,
    backgroundColor: "tomato"
  },
  map: {
    flex: 1
  }
});

export default class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    FlightmapGL.setTelemetryEnabled(false);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.page}>
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <FlightmapGL.MapView 
		  styleURL = '<YOUR_STYLE_URL>'
		  style={styles.map} />
        </View>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
